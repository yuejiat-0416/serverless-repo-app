## About Me  
Hi! My name is Yuejia Tong, and I come from Guangdong, China. I just earned my bachelor degree from New York University with a double major in Comp Sci and Maths, and I will pursue my graduate study in NYU starting this Fall. In my spare time, I enjoy watching NBA, playing video games, and doing sports. My favorite NBA player is Stephen Curry, and my favorite games are CS:GO & Genshin Impact.  
  
I would love to make friends who are pursuing careers as software developers or who share same interests with me. To contact me, my email is: yuejiat0416@gmail.com
